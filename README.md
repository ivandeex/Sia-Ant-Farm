# sia-antfarm
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NebulousLabs/Sia-Ant-Farm.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/NebulousLabs/Sia)

sia-antfarm is a collection of utilities for performing complex, end-to-end
tests of the [Sia](https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia) platform.  These test
are long-running and offer superior insight into high-level network behaviour
than Sia's existing automated testing suite.

# Install

```shell
go get -u gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-Ant-Farm/...
cd $GOPATH/src/gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-Ant-Farm
make dependencies && make
```

# Running a sia-antfarm

This repository contains one utility, `sia-antfarm`. `sia-antfarm` starts up
a number of `siad` instances, using jobs and configuration options parsed from
the input `config.json`. `sia-antfarm` takes a flag, `-config`, which is a path
to a JSON file defining the ants and their jobs. See `nebulous-configs/` for
some examples that we use to test Sia.

An example `config.json`:

`config.json:`
```json
{
	"antconfigs": 
	[ 
		{
			"jobs": [
				"gateway"
			]
		},
		{
			"jobs": [
				"gateway"
			]
		},
		{
			"jobs": [
				"gateway"
			]
		},
		{
			"jobs": [
				"gateway"
			]
		},
		{
			"apiaddr": "127.0.0.1:9980",
			"jobs": [
				"gateway",
				"miner"
			]
		}
	],
	"autoconnect": true
}
```

This `config.json` creates 5 ants, with four running the `gateway` job and one
running a `gateway` and a `miner` job.  If `HostAddr`, `APIAddr`, or `RPCAddr`
are not specified, they will be set to a random port.  If `autoconnect` is set
to `false`, the ants will not automatically be made peers of each other.

Note that the ants connect to each other over the public Internet, so you must
either have UPnP enabled on your router or you must configure your system so
that the ants' `RPCAddr` and `HostAddr` ports are accessible from the Internet.

## Available configuration options:

```
{
	'ListenAddress': the listen address that the `sia-antfarm` API listens on
	'AntConfigs': an array of `AntConfig` objects, defining the ants to run on this antfarm
	'AutoConnect': a boolean which automatically bootstraps the antfarm if provided
	'ExternalFarms': an array of strings, where each string is the api address of an external antfarm to connect to.
}
```

`AntConfig`s have the following options:
```
{
	'APIAddr': the api address for the ant to listen on, by default an unused localhost: bind address will be used.
	'APIPassword': the password to be used for authenticating certain calls to the ant.
	'RPCAddr': the RPC address for the ant to listen on, by default an unused bind address will be used.
	'HostAddr': the Host address for the ant to listen on, by default an unused bind address will be used.
	'SiaDirectory': the data directory to use for this ant, by default a unique directory in `./antfarm-data` will be generated and used.
	'SiadPath': the path to the `siad` binary, by default the `siad` in your path will be used.
	'Jobs': an array of jobs for this ant to run. available jobs include: ['miner', 'host', 'renter', 'gateway']
	'DesiredCurrency': a minimum (integer) amount of SiaCoin that this Ant will attempt to maintain by mining currency. This is mutually exclusive with the `miner` job.
}
```
